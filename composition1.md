Prometheus was a Titan, who stole fire from the gods and gifted it to humankind.
Incensed, Jupiter condemned him to a horrible punishment -
he was chained to a rock where his heart was pecked on by an eagle (and regenerated nightly so the eagle could eat again the next day) until Hercules came along and killed it.

Prometheus titanis ignem de deis cepit eumque ad hominem dedit.
