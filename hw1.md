A regular Latin verb has four principal parts.
The first and third principal parts are finite verb forms. They are both first person singular.
The letter after the "f" in interficiō and faciō is different in all principal parts the verbs except for the third. Everything else is identical.
Audīre and venīre are two verbs belonging to the first conjugation. The third and fourth principal part of venīre is irregular.
The changes in the principal parts of capiō and facio are identical. It is just the letters before the endings that are different.
