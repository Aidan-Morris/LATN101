When the Greek leaders were in Troy for ❗️*how many?*❗️years, Epeus made a wooden horse of magnificent size.
Menelaus, Ulixēs, Diomedes, Thessander, Sthenelus, Acamas, Thoas, Machaon, and Neoptolemus were all gathered inside it.
And on the horse they wrote, "The Greeks of Minerva give❌ a gift", and they carried it from❌ the military camp to Tenedo.
When the Trojans saw it, Priamus led the horse to the temple of Minerva.
Although Cassandra said that the horse held enemies, she was not given any faith, and they still put the horse in front of the temple.
The Greeks exited the horse and killed the guards and Troy❌ was conquered.

1. Highlighting finite verbs and subjects
2. Decem annos: accusative case, used to describe time
3. Fuissent: 3rd person, plural, pluperfect, active, subjunctive. It is pluperfect because the clause is subordinate and takes place entirely before the main clause.
4. Mirae magnitudinis: genitive, plural❌, feminine. The phrase is being used to describe the direct object: equum ligneum.
5. Collecti sunt: 3rd person, plural, perfect, indicative, passive.
6. Cum id Troiani viderunt: subordinating clause and cum is a subordinating conjunction.
7. Ei: dative case, refers to Cassandra in whom faith was not given (recipient of direct object)
8. Exierunt: comes from the prefix 'ex' and the plural active form of the verb eo (3rd principal part: ii)
